```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

smaller <- diamonds |>
  filter(carat <= 2.5)
```

## R markdown practice

We have data about `r nrow(diamonds)` diamonds. Only `r nrow(diamonds) - nrow(smaller)` are larger than 2.5 carats. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
smaller |>
  ggplot(aes(carat)) +
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 0.01)
```
```{r}

```
